# WP Logo Explode

**Seamless Vector Overlay page transitions for SVG logos.**

WP Logo Explode is a WordPress plugin that creates smooth, vector-based page transitions using your SVG logo. It bridges the gap between pages with a dynamic, high-performance animation.

## Features

- **Seamless Transitions:** smooth entry and exit animations using the View Transitions API (or fallback).
- **SVG Driven:** Uses your site's SVG logo for crisp scaling at any resolution.
- **Customizable:** Settings to control animation speed, easing, and style.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on initial page load.

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-logo-explode` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure settings via the WordPress Customizer or dedicated settings page (if applicable).

## Development

This plugin uses Node.js and `@wordpress/scripts` for building assets.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Build Commands

- `npm start` - Starts the build for development with hot reloading.
- `npm run build` - Builds the code for production.
- `npm run packages-update` - Updates WordPress packages.

## Integration with Canvas Animations (Prompt for AI Agents)

If you are generating code with LLMs (like ChatGPT or Claude) for canvas animations on pages using this plugin, use the following **exact prompt** to ensure they coordinate correctly with the page transition.

### The Problem
When navigating via **WP Logo Explode**, the new page content is loaded and the `load` event fires **before** the "shrink" transition completes. Standard `DOMContentLoaded` scripts will start too early, interfering with the transition or having their canvas setup invalid.

### The Solution
The target page script must wait for the transition to finish. The plugin supports a global hook: `window.initializeOnPageCanvasAfterTransition`.

**Robustness:** The transition engine **polls** for this function for up to 2 seconds after the transition completes. This means even if your script loads slightly later than the transition (e.g., due to network delays), the hook will still fire correctly.

### Copy-Paste Prompt for AI
Give this instruction to the AI writing your canvas code:

> **Integration Request:**
> Please refactor the initialization logic of the canvas animation to support the "WP Logo Explode" transition engine.
>
> **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**
> You must expose your initialization function to the global `window` scope so the transition engine can trigger it at the exact right moment.
>
> Please allow the code to run in two modes:
> 1.  **Transition Mode:** The transition engine calls `window.initializeOnPageCanvasAfterTransition()`.
> 2.  **Standard Mode:** The code runs on `window.onload` (only if no transition is active).
>
> **REQUIRED CODE STRUCTURE:**
> Please structure your code exactly like this:
>
> ```javascript
> (function() {
>     // 1. Define your init function
>     function startMyCanvasAnimation() {
>         // Prevent double-init
>         if (window.hasMyCanvasAnimationStarted) return;
>         window.hasMyCanvasAnimationStarted = true;
>
>         console.log('Starting Canvas Animation...');
>         // ... [YOUR CANVAS SETUP CODE HERE] ...
>     }
>
>     // 2. EXPOSE GLOBALLY (Crucial!)
>     window.initializeOnPageCanvasAfterTransition = startMyCanvasAnimation;
>
>     // 3. Handle Normal Page Loads (Fallback)
>     window.addEventListener('load', () => {
>         // If NO transition overlay is present, start immediately.
>         // If an overlay IS present, do nothing; the engine will call the hook above.
>         if (!document.querySelector('.transition-overlay')) {
>             startMyCanvasAnimation();
>         }
>     });
> })();
> ```

## Structure

- `src/` - Source files for JavaScript and block assets.
- `assets/` - Static assets like CSS and additional JS.
- `includes/` - PHP class files and server-side logic.
- `build/` - Compiled assets (generated by `npm run build`).
